# LoomoDancer2
Segway Loomo Robot with Dance moves, headlights and Alexa

This is a clone of the Segway Loomo Developer sample "EmojiVoiceSample" https://github.com/SegwayRoboticsSamples/EmojiVoiceSample

It has been modified to give the robot the ability to do a simple dance and a few other commands e.g. Forward slow/fast via a voice command.

It also includes headlight Control and Home Automation via Amazon Alexa using a purchased version of the Reverb.ai Android app

The app name will show up as Emoji Pet on your Loomo
